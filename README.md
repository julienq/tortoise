A Logo for the Web
==================

The aim of this project is to provide a solid Logo implementation for Web
browsers, and not just a toy interpreter. There should be DOM bindings and
multimedia output using canvas, SVG, audio, video, etc. The language is based
on (but won't be 100% compatible with) [Brian Harvey's UCB
Logo](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/).
